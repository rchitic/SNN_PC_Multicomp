Spiking multicompartment PC network
Abstract
Predictive coding is a promising theoretical framework for understanding the hierarchical sensory processing in the brain, yet how it is implemented with cortical spiking neurons is still unclear. While most existing works have taken a hand-wiring approach to creating microcircuits which match experimental results, recent work in applying the optimisation approach revealed that cortical connectivity might result from self-organisation given some fundamental computational principle, ie. energy efficiency. We thus investigated whether predictive coding properties in a multicompartment spiking neural network can result from energy optimisation. We found that only the model trained with an energy objective in addition to a task-relevant objective was able to reconstruct internal representations given top-down expectation signals alone. Neurons in the energy-optimised model also showed differential responses to expected vs unexpected stimuli, qualitatively similar to experimental evidence for predictive coding. These findings indicated that predictive-coding-like behaviour might be an emergent property of energy optimisation, providing a new perspective on how predictive coding could be achieved in the cortex.
